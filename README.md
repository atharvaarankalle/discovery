Tired of spending hours trying to find a song that perfectly captures this specific feeling you just can't put your
finger on ( ╥ω╥ ) ? Look no further! With _discOvery_, not only can you discover songs that capture this specific
feeling, you can also share what song makes you feel a certain way as well. ☆ ～('▽^人)

### Overview

Our web app, _discOvery_, combines elements of a music streaming service interface and collaborative web apps. Our
app prompts users on a daily basis to share songs that they think best describe these prompts. Other users will be able
to see suggestions in their feeds while using the app.

#### Key Features

- **Daily Prompt:** Each day, users receive a new prompt (all users will have the same prompt) to choose a song that
  best describes that prompt. This daily prompt utilises the OpenAI api to generate each prompt.
- **Discovery Feed:** Users will be able to view the responses of other users who have suggested their own song to that
  best describes the prompt of the day.
- **Song Snippets:** Snippets of the songs the user discovers on the app will be available to listen to while in the
  app. However, some songs don't have a snippet available and the user will instead be given to opportunity to access
  the song through Spotify Web.
- **Basic User Profile:** Users will be able to sign up with an email, password, and display name.
- **Cloud Storage:** User data will be stored in the cloud which offers many benefits such as data security.
- **Streaks:** The user's streak will increment each consecutive day they suggest a song based on the daily prompt.
  Their streak will reset to zero if the user doesn't suggest a song for the daily prompt.
- **Save Discovered Songs**: The user will be able to "like" a song from their Discovery Feed and will be able to access
  these songs from their user profile.

_DISCLAIMER: discOvery is not supported for small screens at the moment (e.g. mobile devices, tablets, small windows)_

Tired of spending hours trying to find a song that perfectly captures this specific feeling you just can't put your
finger on? Look no further! With _discOvery_, not only can you discover songs that capture this specific feeling, but
you can share what song makes you feel a certain way as well!

We hope to unite music enthusiasts and allow users to broaden their listening-music horizons!
